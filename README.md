# Kaleidoscope

> A kaleidoscope (/kəˈlaɪdəskoʊp/) is an optical instrument with two or more reflecting surfaces tilted to each other in an angle, so that one or more (parts of) objects on one end of the mirrors are seen as a regular symmetrical pattern when viewed from the other end, due to repeated reflection. 
--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope

This software extracts a part of an image as a template and simulates the pattern as being viewed through a kaleidoscope.

## Next steps
The current implementation provides only one mirror system, which is 60-60-60 or equilateral triangle.

30-60-90 and 45-90-45 mirror systems are to be added. 


It is planned to provide the capability of generating animations from specified ranges of input parameters (e.g. offset and angle).
